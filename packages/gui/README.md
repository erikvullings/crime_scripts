# Crime Scripts

A web application to create crime scripts.

## Installation

The application is a mono-repository, developed in TypeScript. It typically consists of the following packages:

## Development

```bash
pnpm i
npm start
```

## Crime-script data

Scenes own their activity-group variants directly. Reusable taxonomies such as roles, attributes, transports, locations, products, and partners remain shared across scripts.

In the taxonomy editor, administrators can merge two items of the same type: the retained item's label and details win, while references in categories and in both public and restricted scripts are redirected to it. Review the retained item's details before merging, because a public script referencing it will include it in public exports. The merge remains cancellable until the taxonomy changes are saved.

Legacy JSON models with a top-level `acts` collection and schema-version-2 models are migrated when loaded. Scene, variant, and track IDs are preserved, while a reused legacy act is copied into each owning script so later edits cannot affect another script. Newly saved and exported models use `schemaVersion: 3`.

On first launch, users choose the fixed Dutch starter library at `/starter-bundles/nl.json` or an empty workspace. Starter imports are explicit and preserve local conflicts by default. Script language, AI/review provenance, starter origin, and source usage notes remain in JSON and Word exports.

The Dutch and English public starter bundles retain their own taxonomy IDs and include descriptions, synonyms, and category ancestry from matching taxonomy items used by their public scripts. Taxonomy exclusive to restricted scripts is not included in the public bundles.

The Dutch starter library contains ten AI-assisted, unreviewed public-safety scripts. Its original content is available under CC BY 4.0; third-party bibliography items retain their own rights. See `/starter-bundles/NOTICE.nl.md`. Icon requirements for the separate catalogue work are recorded in `/starter-bundles/icon-requirements.nl.json`.

Every script has a `public` or `restricted` classification and a stable family ID that links counterparts. The global script mode defaults to public and is only persisted after the user switches it. Public exports omit restricted scripts and their private-only taxonomy data. Restricted JSON and Word exports require confirmation and use classified filenames and document headers; permanent links are unavailable when their model contains restricted content.

The application-level icon catalogue is available in `/icons/catalogue.json`, so built-in icons remain available in empty workspaces and single-script exports only need to retain their stable `builtin:*` key. Uploaded images remain embedded as data URLs. Catalogue provenance and licensing are documented in `/icons/NOTICE.md`. Optimize catalogue artwork before committing changes:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/gui icons:optimize
```

## Deployment to GitHub docs

```bash
pnpm i
npm run build:domain
```
